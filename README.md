# ImageProcessingApp

This project is an image processing application developed using PyQt5. You can easily perform various image processing operations through a user-friendly interface. The project offers a wide range of features from basic image manipulations to advanced operations.

## Features
- **Image Loading and Saving:** You can load and save images in PNG, JPG, JPEG and BMP formats.
- **Brightness and Contrast Adjustment:** You can increase or decrease the image brightness, adjust the contrast.
- **Grayscale and Color Channels:** You can convert the image to grayscale, and view the RGB channels separately.
- **Geometric Transformations:** You can rotate, mirror, tilt and scale the image.
- **Shape Drawing:** You can create frames by drawing rectangles, circles, ellipses and polygons, and crop outside the frame.
- **Filtering:** You can apply blurring and sharpening operations to the image.
- **Edge Detection:** You can find edges with Canny and Sobel algorithms.
- **Closed Area Operations:** You can color closed areas, perform erosion and expansion operations.
- **Operations on Two Images:** You can add, subtract and combine two images with logical operators (AND, NAND, OR, NOR, XOR).
- **Background Subtraction:** You can remove the background from the image, perform special operations such as tree-shadow merging.
- **History and Forward:** You can easily manage your operations with undo and forward.
